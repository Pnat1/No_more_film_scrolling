# Introduction

This is my final project for the Data Analysis course done at Ironhack Bootcamp Madrid. 

I have decided to create a film recomender system using content and collaborative procedures depending on the individualidarity of the users tastes, inputs, and reviews. The project aims to sum up many of the tools and knowledge learned throughout the two month intensive bootcamp.


# Project Objectives

- Obtain a substantially big movie dataset with movie descriptions, ratings, votes. The chosen site was IMDb as it also had an accesible API to do request from. Yet, in the end I found appropiate alrady web-scrapped datatsets in Kaggle.

- Proper understanding of data through data Cleaning/Processing and Visualizations. 

- Tidy organisation of the project where ultimately each file must be dedicated to one process in particular.
